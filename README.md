How to Use the Tic-Tac-Toe Game:
Simply open the HTML file in a web browser using a live server (like VS Codeâ€™s Live Server). Click on any empty box to place your mark (Player X starts first). 
The game will show whose turn it is at the top, and when there's a winner or a draw, it will display the result. 
A "Reset" button is also available to start a new round. Once the game ends, further moves are disabled until the reset button is clicked.
